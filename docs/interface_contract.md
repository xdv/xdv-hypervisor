# Interface Contract
Project: XDV Domain Hypervisor
Specification: XDV-014
Forge: XdvHypervisor
## Versioning
- Interface version: 0.1.0
- Stability tier: stable-alpha
## Contract Rules
- Exported procedures must preserve deterministic behavior for identical inputs.
- Return code semantics are part of the public contract and cannot change without a major version bump.
- Domain tags, capability masks, and status constants are externally visible contract data.
- New constants/procedures must be additive unless major-version upgrade is declared.
## Current Public Files
- src/hypervisor.ds
- src/hypervisor_interface.ds
## Migration Notes
This project was split from xdv-kernel/sector/xdv_hypervisor.
Kernel integration paths should progressively switch from sector-local imports to versioned dependency usage.
